        <h1>Naveen Reddy Venna act in a play</h1>
        <h4>The Master Builder : Henrik Ibsen</h4>
        <h6>KAIA</h6>  <p> FOSLI enters quietly by the door on the left.</p>


            <h6>SOLNESS</h6>
            
            <p>[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:]</p> . <p>Well, is
            that you?</p>
            
            
            <h6>KAIA</h6>
            
           <p>I merely wished to let you know that I have come.</p>
            
            
            <h6>SOLNESS</h6>
            
            <p>Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?</p>
            
            
            <h6>KAIA</h6>
            
            <p>No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
            coming presently to hear--</p>
            
            
            <h6>SOLNESS</h6>
            
           <p>How is the old man to-day?</p>
            
            
            <h6>KAIA</h6>
            
            <p>Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
            to-day.</p>
            
            
            <h6>SOLNESS</h6>
            
            <p>Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.</p>
            
            
            <h6>KAIA</h6>
            
            <p>Yes. [Pauses at the door.]</p>. <p>Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?</p>
            
            
            <h6>SOLNESS</h6>
            
           <p> No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.</p>
